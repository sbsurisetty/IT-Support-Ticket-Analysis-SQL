# IT Support Ticket Analysis with SQL
---
![Project Banner](./banner.png)
---
Welcome to my SQL project focused on analyzing support ticket data from an IT department. This project explores how structured queries and data interpretation can help solve real-world challenges faced by support teams—from missed SLA deadlines to tracking technician performance.

---

## 🔍 What’s This Project About?

This project is based on a fictional IT support dataset. I used **MySQL** to write queries that answer practical business questions like:

- Which departments log the most support tickets?
- Are technicians closing tickets on time?
- Which issues take the longest to resolve?
- Who are the most efficient technicians?
- Are SLAs being breached frequently, and by whom?

The idea here is to show how SQL isn't just about syntax—it's about solving real problems and finding insights that teams can actually act on.

## 💡 What You'll Find Inside

- ✅ Clean, structured SQL queries
- ✅ Department-wise SLA breach analysis
- ✅ Technician performance breakdown
- ✅ Resolution time averages by priority
- ✅ Ticket volume trends over time

Every query is based on a real question you'd hear in an IT team meeting or during an operational review.

## 📁 About the Dataset

This dataset includes over **10,000 support tickets** and covers fields like:

- Department  
- Issue Type  
- Priority  
- Status (Open/Closed/Escalated)  
- Created and Resolved Dates  
- Assigned Technician  
- SLA Breach Flags  
- Feedback Ratings  

---

## 📊 A Few Key Insights

- The **IT department** logged the highest number of tickets (unsurprisingly).
- **Bob** and **Frank** consistently resolved the most tickets.
- The **Finance department** topped the SLA breach list.
- **Critical priority** issues took slightly longer to resolve than low-priority ones.
- **March 2025** saw a spike in support tickets.

These findings are based purely on SQL queries—no external tools used for analytics.

## 👋 Why I Built This

I wanted to create a project that not only showcases SQL syntax but also reflects how data is used in real business environments. IT support teams run into these issues daily—and this analysis could actually help optimize their operations.

If you're reviewing this as a potential employer:  
👉 This is the kind of hands-on work I enjoy doing. It's logical, structured, and rooted in real use cases.
